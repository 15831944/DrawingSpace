============

Common operations useful for developing in AutoCAD with .NET.

Usage
============

The only class needed is DrawingSpace.cs. You can just copy this class into your project
and use it. For a quick tutorial on how to use it see the methods in Samples.cs.

Alternatively, you can clone the entire repository and use it as a starting point for a
new project, just make sure to add references to acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll and
set the Copy Local property to false.
